# ==== requires you to have imported the VMware.VimAutomation.Core module, and be connected to 1 ore more vCenter servers to query =====

# This script loops through all connected vCenter servers, and for each VMware ESXi host shows its vmkernel ip settings.
# In this scenario I only show vmk0 to vmk5, since during this project the maximum nr of vmkernel adapters was 6, but its easy to extend or modify.
# the data is passed to a custom powershell object.
